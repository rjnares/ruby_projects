# Ruby Projects

These are my implementations of the [Basic Ruby Projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby#basic-ruby-projects) assigned in the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) of the [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) curriculum from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

These projects are meant to reinforce the concepts learned in the [Basic Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby#basic-ruby) course.
